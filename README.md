# ðŸ”· Rotated & Squashed Grid in Pygame

[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) 

- Draw a grid of squares ðŸ’   
- Rotate each square by 45Â° ðŸŒ€  
- Squash the entire grid vertically to give an **isometric/diamond** look ðŸ’Ž  

Perfect for learning:
- Coordinate transforms
- Rotation with trigonometry
- Y-axis scaling (squash)
- Drawing polygons with math!

## ðŸŽ® What It Looks Like

A dreamy diamond grid, like a tactical RPG board or early isometric game world.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### ðŸ§° Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- `pygame` library  

### ðŸ“¦ Install Pygame:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
## ðŸ§  How It Works
* Define a regular grid of squares (rectangles).

* Rotate each squareâ€™s corners around the center of the screen using a rotation matrix.

* Apply a vertical "squash factor" to make everything look flat (isometric-style).

* Draw each squashed, rotated square using pygame.draw.polygon().
